//somekind of algorithm:

//   declare new fucntion, that takes in a string as a parameter, 
//   in the body of the function:
//   declare new empty array named "result";
//   initialize to a new variable the result of invoking built-in method .split(), use white space as a parameter, which returns an array which elements are an every single word of the string
//   invoke for loop, starts from 0 up to the length of the array. Every iteration of which will push into array "results" following:
// invoke method ".charAt()" on i's element of arr array, that takes in "0"  as a parameter, which refer to the index, and returns first letter of the i's element variable, then make this letter capitalized via invoking on it .toUpperCase() built-in method. Then concatenate to the first capitalized character the rest of the string, which we are getting via invoking on i's array's element .slice() method which take in "1" as a parameter (that refers to the start slicing character index) and returns the whole str string of i's element except first character.
// return a string obtained by invoking .join() method on the array "result" and set in white space (" ") as a parameter


//pseudo code

// procedure titleCase(string)
// new empty array

// string <- splits string use white space

// for each (word in new string)
// ( word <- first letter uppercase + slice rest of the string )
// return new string with white space


function capitalize (str) {
    // var str = str.replace(/\s\i\s/gm, " I ");
    var result = [];
    var arr = str.split(" ");

    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
      result.push(arr[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + arr[i].slice(1));
    }
    return result.join(" ");
  
}



alert( capitalize('whatever challenging the task seems to you at first glance, just do it step by step, i tell you, even an elephant is eaten by small pieces ') );
